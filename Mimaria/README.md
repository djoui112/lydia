##  Project Overview

Mimaria is an **online platform designed to connect architects, architecture agencies, and clients** in one collaborative environment. In many regions, architects must be affiliated with an agency to legally manage projects — our platform simplifies this process by allowing agencies to assign and oversee architects directly through the system.

The platform provides **dedicated profiles and portfolios** for both agencies and architects, enabling them to showcase their work, manage projects, and collaborate efficiently. Meanwhile, **clients can easily request design or construction projects** according to their preferred style and specifications.

With a **minimal, clean, and user-friendly interface**, the website ensures a smooth experience for all users. It also prioritizes **security and functionality**, integrating various tools and features designed to make project management and communication more efficient for both professionals and clients.
